Round 1 : 
1. Components used to create an EC2 instance using Terraform.
2. Uses of Provisioners in Terraform ? 
Ans: Installing software after creating a VM, Running configuration scripts, and bootstrapping an instance.
---------------------------------------------------
3. Why do we need to use a provisioner for SSH connection (Wrong answer given by me)
ANS: To SSH into an instance, we need to use the  " connection".
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt update",
      "sudo apt install -y nginx"
    ]
  }

  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. When to use a " Null" resource in Terraform.
5. Routing policies in Route53.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Routing Policy         | Description                                                                 | Use Case Example                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Simple**             | Basic DNS record with a single value or multiple values (returned randomly) | Static website, basic load balancing     |
| **Weighted**           | Route traffic based on assigned weights                                     | Canary deployments, load testing         |
| **Latency-based**      | Route traffic to the region with the lowest latency                         | Global apps needing low-latency response |
| **Failover**           | Route to primary unless it's unhealthy, then route to secondary             | High availability/failover setups        |
| **Geolocation**        | Route based on the **user's location (country/continent)**                  | Legal compliance, localized content      |
| **Geo-proximity**      | Route based on proximity to AWS regions **with bias control**               | Fine-tuned global traffic distribution   |
| **Multi-Value Answer** | Return multiple healthy records (basic load balancing with health checks)   | Application-level redundancy             |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Why is an Inline policy?
7. How was it different from custom-managed policies?
🔐 Inline Policy
Created by: The user (administrator) directly within a specific IAM user, group, or role.

Attached to: Only one identity (a specific user, group, or role).

Visibility: Not listed under IAM → Policies in the console.

Scope: Exists only within the identity it's attached to.

Deletion: Automatically deleted when the identity is deleted.

🧠 Think of it as a private policy living inside a single user/role/group.

🛠️ Customer Managed Policy
Created by: The user (administrator) in the Policies section of IAM.

Attached to: Multiple IAM identities — users, groups, and roles.

Visibility: Visible under IAM → Policies as a standalone policy.

Scope: Can be reused, modified, and versioned.

Deletion: Must be manually deleted.

8. Which CI/CD tool? How to establish the connection.
9. What are the different stages present in the pipeline?
10. How do you containerize the application?
11. How do we maintain different versions of a container, and how do we tag them?
12. Will this deploy every time in production?
13. What happens if we push the image 
14. Will you do any tests on images before pushing to Docker Hub?
15. We deployed an application in Kubernetes using rolling updates, but we observed that the new pods are not coming how to fix it.
16. Set -E : 
17. responds codes [ 500 
18. How do we monitor 
======================================================================================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
====================================================================================================================================
1. Explain the CI/CD pipeline in detail.
2. How do you use Terraform
3. My primary responsibilities
4. How complex details I worked on K8s.
5. And how big an issue was the k8s?
6. How many pipelines do we use?
7. AWS high-level architecture.
8. Sidecart container vs init container
ANS: 
INIT : 
Run once before the main application containers start.
Lifecycle: Sequential — each init container must complete successfully before the next starts, and all must finish before
App containers start.Runs to completion and then exits.
📌 Example Use Cases:
Copying files or configs to a shared volume.
Ensuring a dependency (like a DB) is reachable.
Running a script to prepare an environment.
Sidecart:
Run alongside the main application container(s), providing supporting functionality.
Lifecycle: Starts with the main container and shares the pod lifecycle. Can restart if the Pod does.
✅ Characteristics:
Runs concurrently with app containers.
Shares networking and volumes with other containers in the Pod.
Often used to enhance or extend main container functionality.
📌 Example Use Cases:
Log shippers (e.g., Fluent Bit).
Proxy or service mesh sidecar (e.g., Envoy in Istio).
File sync, metrics collection, or backup services.

9. How to share the data between the host and different Docker containers how to do.
| Feature     | Bind Mounts              | Docker Volumes                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Path        | Host filesystem          | Docker-managed location        |
| Portability | Less portable            | More portable                  |
| Setup Ease  | Requires host path setup | Docker manages everything      |
| Best For    | Direct host access       | Container-to-container sharing |
docker volume create shared-data
Volumes: 
docker run -v shared-data:/data --name container1 myimage
docker run -v shared-data:/data --name container2 myimage
BindMount : 
docker run -v /host/data:/container/data --name container1 myimage
docker run -v /host/data:/container/data --name container2 myimage
