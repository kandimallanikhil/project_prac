3 tire architecture : 
            1. Web Server
            2. App Server
            3. DB Server
For any server, the data will be stored in the 3. DB server, which we can not read. through SQL queries 2. APP servers will check the data and send O/P.
And 1. Web server will put the data in HTML format.so that it will be human readable format.
So the flow will be like ------------- DB Server --> APP Server ---> Web Server. To secure the DB server we don't provide access to everyone to DB server. So every request will be sent throgh 
App server.
-> The load will be transferred to the web server using a Load Balancer. and LB will get the request from Users.
1. Data Base Server: Mysql, Oracle, MongoDB, etc...
2. APP/API server (Backend Tire): Java,Python, Nodejs,Dotnet ,GO etc...
3. Web (Front End tire ): HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, etc...

There are two types of applications  1. Static Application   2. Dynamic Application
 1. Static Application: Front End applications are static --> Nginx, Apache, etc...
2. Dynamic application: Backend applications are dynamic --> Tomcat etc...
My SQL is a database server that stores the data and to segregate the data easily we will store the data in schema or tables.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Node.Js --> Package.json ==> where we will store name, project description, dependencies, and versions. 
build tool: npm --> It will search the package and get the required dependencies.
java -- > pom.xml, Build tool: maven.
python -- > requirments.txt, build tool: pip.

=============================
/etc/nginx  --> Nginx config is here
/usr/share/nginx/html/ -> hear we need to place our website.
/var/log/nginx/ --> Here nginx will place the logs
/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html  --> load automatically when we hit the page.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DNS(Domain Name System) - We will store the IP address in DNS. Even if we change the IP or if we restart the system, the DNS name will not change.

Domain registers (this will provide domain to us) - GoDaddy, Hostinger, AWS, AZURE, etc...
Domain names are unique in the universe.
============================================
What will happen when we hit a Domain name in the browser : 
eg: nikhil.com 
if we are using a new laptop and opening the browser for the first time, 
------ >> First it will check its browser cache for the IP of nikhil.com. ----> If it didnt find the then Browser will contact
OS for the IP address of nikhil.com, OS will check its cache now if it is not found ( Now as it was not present in the browser and OS)
ISP is responsible for the DNS resolution ( Means providing IP address to DNS)
Our OS will be enabled to contact ISP DNS resolution. then ISP DNS resolution will check its cache if it dosent found it will
check with ROOT servers.
Root servers: this will store all the DNS names.
This will scan the domain we asked for.

TTD : (Top level domain) eg : " .com, .in, .net, etc.... each TTD will be managed by a company. When we request a .com TTD website
then 
root server will inform the DNS resolver to contact " .com TTD " and it will also provide the address(of name) details.
DNS resolver will contact .com TTDto provide the IP address
TTD checks the status and provides the IP address of nikhil.com.
------------------------
Now we now how we will get an IP address but in DNS we need to give our IP details then only our Server will have an IP, by default 
DNS will not have any IP.
and this process is called records.
Records : 
A - Record: In this we need to add our public IP address

Name Servers: whenever we book a domain we will get name servers for the domain.
A Records: IP address
CNAME: Another domain redirects
Mx: Mail Server
NS : name server
SOA : Authorization
TXT: validation purpose.
========================== ----------------- ==============================
Reverse Proxy && Forward Proxy 

111 ->  Forward Proxy : 
Eg 1: if we are trying to access data or content which is restricted in our location then we will use VPN so that our location 
will be changed in other regions and we can access the data. 
eg 2: If we are working from home then we can not access our servers because of restrictions. But if we use VPN we can connect.
---------
--> You can watch restricted content 
--> we can change our geolocation 
--> client-side proxy, in eg 1 we are changing our location but the owner of the server will not be aware of our server they will 
only know about the VPN server we are connected to they won't know our geo location.
--> Hidding our cline identity
--> Traffic Monitoring ( In our office laptops they can monitor the traffic we are using)
--> Secure connection 
--> Content access restriction
=========================
222 - > Reverse Proxy : 
->In this only the server (the application we are accessing) is aware of proxy.
-> Security b/w client and server.
-> acts as a Load Balancer (Nginx LB)
->
