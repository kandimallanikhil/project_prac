AWS 
IAM : (User will get access to services through IAM, IAM can provide authorization and authentication)
AWS Root account can manage IAM(can control the permission of the whole AWS account and services), Billing, and Resources(Ec2,s3..)
ARN : This will be a unique id for the resource created in AWS.
Case 1 : If a user has allow access at the user level and the group has Denay access. The user¬†can not access the s3.
case 2 : If a user has denie access at the user level and the group has Allow access. The user can not access the s3.
Note: this means if the user has an explicit deny policy (whether directly attached or via another group), the deny will take precedence and block the access.

AWS Organizations: An organization in AWS is a collection of AWS accounts that are centrally managed.
Each AWS account is an independent resource container with its own set of resources, users, and IAM roles.
- > It was like we could have one account(Nikhil) as root account. and inside that we can creates multiple accounts 
like prod,dev,stage. But all these accounts are separate the will have their own root account, users, IAM policies. But all this is linked with one root account 
called (Nikhil) which we can use it for billing 
- > Once user from one account can not access other account resources by default. But we need to enable cross-region access through IAM policies to access it.
How to create a AWS organization : 

Root account -> AWS organization -> ( By default we will get the root account and management account(the account which we login ))
Select Root -> actions -> Create New OU -> OU Name -> create OU (This is not an account just the OU, to know the difference between the accounts)
Creating an account: Select (_OU_created_above_) -> add an AWS account -> fill in the required details -> Create an AWS account.
In case if the AWS account was inside the (_OU_created_above_) then we need to move it manually 
Select (test account) -> action-> Move -> (_OU_created_above_) -> Move AWS account.
-----------------
To login to the newly created account as we don't have any credentials we need to use forgot password option to get the password, and we have email at the time of creation of the account.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS Roles: These are not assigned to the user but they are assigned to services, and AWS roles will be assigned to services
in aws and from that with out using any (keys) we can access other service.

The manin use of these roles are 
eg : If the user is working programmatically (using the AWS SDKs, CLI, or a service), they will need 
access keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) to authenticate their actions.
eg: we have a developer who works on some coding and whenever they need to connect to other AWS services they will use an (access key or secret key)
to connect to AWS and they won't use the AWS UI as they should connect the code.
case 1 > If a user was provided access to aws ec2 instance -> now he needs to access some files present in AWS s3 -> 
but he can not access it -> Now we need to  assign a role to the user now he can access it.
in this, we need to create a policy and attach it.
Case 2 > We have a user who has access to s3 now he wants to push some files to s3 -> to do that he need to use (keys)
if we assign any role without keys he can push.
once the role is created we need to assign it to EC2 at ec2 level.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But this was not recommended to provide (access key or secret key) to developers.


AWS ROles : Temporary access without credentials(Instead of using long-term credentials (like access keys or passwords) to manage access, roles allow temporary access and help with security and compliance.)
1 ec2 instance will have only 1 AWS role at a time.
1 AWS role can be assigned to multiple instances.
Why AWS Roles are Used:
1. Temporary Security Credentials
2. Cross-Account Access
Different Types of AWS Roles:
	#(Not sure better not to take)1. IAM Roles for Users: Example: A user needing to temporarily gain admin permissions for troubleshooting.
	2.IAM Roles for AWS Services:Example: An EC2 instance assuming a role to access S3 buckets or DynamoDB tables.
	3.IAM Roles for Cross-Account Access:Example: A service in Account A needing to assume a role in Account B to read data from S3.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example of IAM Policy : 

1. Effect
What it means: Specifies whether the statement allows or denies access.
Allowed values: "Allow" or "Deny"
Example:
"Effect": "Allow" || " Effect " : "Deny" ..
This means the policy will permit the specified actions.
--------------
2. Action
What it means: Specifies the AWS service actions that are allowed or denied.( For suppose we just need to provide minimal 
minimal access, like only read  or write access.
Format: "service-prefix:action-name"

Example:
"Action": "s3:ListBucket" - this will provide only list access on S3.
This allows the action ListBucket on the S3 service.

You can use "*" to allow all actions:
"Action": "*": This will provide access to all the resources present in AWS.

Multiple specific actions:

"Action": [
  "s3:GetObject",  ::: This will provide both get and put in S3.
  "s3:PutObject"
]
------------------------------------	
Resouce
What it means: Specifies the resource(s) (e.g., an S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, etc.) the action applies to. 
Format: ARN (Amazon Resource Name)
Example:
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-example-bucket" # In this, it will only point to a specific bucket, but not the objects present.
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-example-bucket/*" # In this, it will only point to a specific bucket and objects present in it.
"Resource": "*" # This will point to all the buckets present in the S3.
---------
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-example-bucket/*"

===========================================
 Inline Policy VS üõ†Ô∏è Customer Managed Policy

üîê Inline Policy
Created by: The user (administrator) directly within a specific IAM user, group, or role.

Attached to: Only one identity (a specific user, group, or role).

Visibility: Not listed under IAM ‚Üí Policies in the console.

Scope: Exists only within the identity it's attached to.

Deletion: Automatically deleted when the identity is deleted.

üß† Think of it as a private policy living inside a single user/role/group.

üõ†Ô∏è Customer Managed Policy
Created by: The user (administrator) in the Policies section of IAM.

Attached to: Multiple IAM identities ‚Äî users, groups, and roles.

Visibility: Visible under IAM ‚Üí Policies as a standalone policy.

Scope: Can be reused, modified, and versioned.

Deletion: Must be manually deleted.
